        Else
            Print gpa, cridet and  fail courses with their gpa

    I think it's a great overall program but it's missing some user experience touches:
    
    1- one example for the people that don't know how to use it || Done 
    
    2- shorten the time of insertion (it takes a lot of time to insert the grades) || Done
    
    3- make some validation: any number or character can inserted || Done
